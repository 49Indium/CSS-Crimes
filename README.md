# CSS-Crimes
The slides for my UQCS Talk "CSS Crimes" (recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LT1VnU3YKA)). It was run as a live demo, where I styled `slides.html` to look like a slide deck, went over some CSS hacks such as the checkbox hack and recursion, then made a binary calculator. The CSS in it's completed form by the end of the talk is in `complete.css`.
